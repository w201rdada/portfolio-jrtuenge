## Health confounded.

They say that in every lie there’s a kernel of truth. There are a multitude of health conditions for which no cure has been discovered, and this is often due at least in part to there being no known cause. With limited ability to conduct human subjects testing, and insufficient capacity to investigate all of the various maladies in existence, we are often left to rely on observational studies in lieu of controlled experiments. Lacking satisfactory solutions from the medical profession, many turn to the Internet out of desperation, in spite of it being notoriously riddled with potentially harmful misinformation. Even if a condition has been accurately diagnosed, unsuitable treatments can fail to improve health -— or perhaps make it worse.

## Light at the end of the tunnel.

Crowdsourcing seems to be in the trough of its hype cycle, having been overtaken by data mining of inadvertent contributions from social media. But what if we could create a network of patients who share a single accurate diagnosis in common? Imagine providing an environment for them to actively brainstorm together, where they could offer and compare ideas for all sorts of potential causes -- ranging from deodorant ingredients to nervous habits? Sure, most of the data would probably be a little wide of the mark, and some commonalities would be no less prevalent in the rest of the population. But even if only one in ten such networks bears fruit, wouldn’t this make it all worthwhile? 

Fortunately, the solution is already here, embodied in the Kernel of Health patient-centric system. To ensure network quality, participant admittance and retention in the system is controlled by the doctors responsible for their diagnosis. Participants are only identifiable by their doctors, and provide consent after being fully informed regarding the allowed usage of their submitted data. Participants are encouraged to create and populate new variables, however nonsensical they might be, and the system distributes these new variables to other participants to populate in turn. All have skin in the game, so to speak, so engagement is robust. And although patients inevitably bring their own biases to the system, their ideas are distributed randomly to ensure the system does not worsen the confusion. 

## Out of the darkness.

With just one year under its belt, the Kernel of Health system has already identified likely culprits for several idiopathic health conditions, and research aimed at vetting these promising new leads is underway. Although the potential value of this dataset for other applications is not lost on corporations, the safeguards that were initially put in place have been preserved and reinforced over time to ensure that participant privacy remains intact. Even for participants whose conditions remain without known cause, engagement with doctors is improved, and reliance on Internet quackery is reduced -— all to the benefit of the patients and science.
