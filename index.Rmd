# Big Ideas for Health and Science {-}

<!-- You can include images saved within your repo... -->
```{r hello-world,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Hello World!',fig.align='center',out.width='50%'}

The following sections detail my two big ideas for data science. The first idea, A Kernel of Health, seeks to find possible causes for idiopathic medical conditions by harnessing networks of patients to reveal patterns that have thus far gone undetected. The second idea, A Speaker for Crows, aims to leverage available recorded calls by crows and other corvids to enable bird identification without the need for tagging. As I explain in the short video linked below, these proposals are presented in order of priority and anticipated impact -- I hope you will agree that the first is particularly worthy of continued team development!
