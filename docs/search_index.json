The first idea, A Kernel of Health, seeks to find possible causes for idiopathic medical conditions by harnessing networks of patients to reveal patterns that have thus far gone undetected. The second idea, A Speaker for Crows, aims to leverage available recorded calls by crows and other corvids to enable bird identification without the need for tagging. As I explain in the short video linked below, these proposals are presented in order of priority and anticipated impact – I hope you will agree that the first is particularly worthy of continued team development!

There are a multitude of health conditions for which no cure has been discovered, and this is often due at least in part to there being no known cause. The efficiency of medical research is constrained by our limited ability to conduct human subjects testing, often forcing us to rely on observational studies in lieu of controlled experiments, and leaving us with insufficient capacity to investigate all of the various maladies in existence. Lacking satisfactory solutions from the medical profession, many turn to the Internet out of desperation, in spite of it being notoriously riddled with pseudoscience and potentially harmful misinformation [1]. Even if a condition has been accurately diagnosed, vain analysis and sham treatments can fail to improve health—or perhaps make it worse [2]. 1.3 Light at the end of the tunnel Crowdsourcing seems to be in the trough of its hype cycle, but patients often have novel (ahem) hypotheses regarding possible etiology of their ailment, and why not harness this energy? What if we could create a network, moderated by their doctors, for patients who share a single accurate diagnosis? Imagine providing an environment for them to brainstorm together, where they could offer and compare ideas for all sorts of potential causes, ranging from deodorant ingredients to nervous habits? Sure, most of the data would probably be a little wide of the mark, and some commonalities would be no less prevalent in the rest of the population. But even if only one in ten such networks leads to a new and efficacious remedy, wouldn’t this justify panning for a little gold? Fortunately, the solution is already here, embodied in the Kernel of Health patient-centric system. To ensure network quality, participant admittance and retention in the system is controlled by the doctors responsible for their diagnosis. Participants are only identifiable by their doctors, and provide consent after being fully informed regarding the allowed usage of their submitted data. They’re encouraged to create (and upvote) new variables, however nonsensical they might be, and the system distributes these new variables to other participants to upvote in turn. All participants have skin in the game, so to speak, so engagement is robust. And although patients inevitably bring their own biases to the system, two safeguards have been put in place to ensure the system does not worsen the confusion. First, patients must submit a set of initial hypotheses before gaining access to the hypotheses of other participants. Second, rather than being allowed a full view of the hypothesis population, each participant is presented with a random sample of equally-weighted hypotheses before being allowed to submit additional hypotheses of their own (perhaps inspired by their view of the sample). 1.4 Out of the darkness With just one year under its belt, the Kernel of Health system has already identified likely culprits for several idiopathic health conditions, and research aimed at vetting these promising new leads is underway. Although the potential value of this dataset for other applications is not lost on corporations, the safeguards that were initially put in place have been preserved and reinforced over time to ensure that participant privacy remains intact. Even for participants whose conditions remain without known cause, salubrious engagement with doctors is enhanced, and reliance on Internet quackery and nostrums is reduced—all to the benefit of the patients and science. 1.5 References [1] http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-reporting-on-quacks-and-pseudoscience-20150413-column.html [2] http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/03/476673789/china-investigates-search-engine-baidu-after-student-dies-of-cancer "],

So when I found a young crow one day in my backyard I promptly dispatched it, thinking this was a mercy. A year later, its friends and family clearly still hadn’t forgiven me [1,2]. Several years later, I watched “A Murder of Crows” on PBS and finally understood the gravity of my crime [3]. Although I eventually served my penance in their minds, my interest in corvids and other intelligent wild birds has since only grown. Crows fortunately tend to thrive in the presence of humans, and their brainpower isn’t lost on the data science community [4,5]. Machine-learning has been applied to crowdsourced data to study migration patterns [6], but prior to our work, data science had not been used for bird identification. We recognized that if birds could be identified by their distinctive vocal signatures, this could save substantial time for ornithologists while also reducing the stress for birds associated with tagging. 2.3 Many birds, one Rosetta stone American crows express themselves in subsong (albeit more like a cacophany to most human ears), and are known to use over 20 different calls [7]. Subtle differences between vocal signatures were believed to identify individuals, and dialects distinguish groups [8]. Software was already available to analyze crow calls [9], and earbuds capable of real-time human language translation were recently introduced [10]. Provided a large body of data for a set of tagged birds, we employed supervised machine learning, trained to recognize the following: call meaning/type, call source (i.e., individual), and source grouping (e.g., dialect, age, sex). We then produced a beta version of our CrowSpeak smartphone app for use by ornithologists, who are already proving to be enthusiastic adopters of this bird identification tool, while also informing its ongoing development. Once ready, the first public release will be used to enlist the help of birdwatchers around the country, thereby greatly diversifying the dataset. We will soon have enough data to further isolate features of vocal signatures that may further improve accuracy by recognizing factors such as demeanor and social status. It is already clear that tagging can in the near future be obviated entirely. 2.4 We were promised Darwins We have not yet established a robust means of conversing with crows or any other intelligent non-human species on its own terms. And maybe that’s for the better – perhaps we’d only learn that, in addition to sounding obnoxious, they’re really only interested in yelling at us to give them a peanut [11]. Indeed, work on communicating with other species has recently met with justified skepticism [12]. But scientific discoveries are often (if not by definition) surprising, and for the time being, the potential benefits (for humans and non-humans alike) of inter-species communication can only be guessed at. In the interim, the ability to identify birds by their calls is empowering, and the prospect of soon understanding their language is thrilling. 2.5 References [1] http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/science/26crow.html [2] http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2016/meet-bird-brainiacs-american-crow [3] http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/a-murder-of-crows-crow-facts/5965/ [4] https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos402/lectures/402-lec1.pdf [5] http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/modeling/ [6] https://research.cornell.edu/news-features/statistics-machine-learning-uncertainty [7] https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Crow/sounds [8] http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2007/02/analysis-shows-differences-alarm-calls-individual-crows [9] http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/raven/RavenOverview.html [10] https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-pixel-buds-are-wireless-earbuds-that-translate-conversations-in-real-time/ [11] https://io9.gizmodo.com/heres-what-crows-and-ravens-are-really-saying-1649142811 [12] http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/08/koko_kanzi_and_ape_language_research_criticism_of_working_conditions_and.html "]
