## Bright minds shrouded in darkness

It was in 2008 or so that I killed my first and only crow. Growing up in the country, I had been taught that a helpless bird on the ground was as good as dead; a quick death was a mercy. So when I found a young crow one day in my back yard, I dispatched it without much thought. Over a year later, the neighborhood crows still hadn't forgiven me. It wasn't until a few years later that I watched "A Murder of Crows" on PBS and finally understood the gravity of my crime -- and the penance I had served [1]. 

We have not yet established a robust means of conversing with crows or any other intelligent non-human species on its own terms. Without such communication, we cannot reliably distinguish sentience from basic problem solving and parroting (i.e., mimicry). Science is full of surprises, and the potential benefits (for humans and non-humans alike) of inter-species communication can only be guessed at in the interim. 

## Many birds, one Rosetta stone

Given that crows are known to use at least 250 different calls, they seem a logical candidate for human-animal communcation research. If we can make earbuds capable of real-time translation [4], surely we can also make speakers to complete the circuit.

The intelligence of crows and other corvids is not lost on the machine-learning community [2]. However, there does not appear to be much research yet into application of data science to understanding corvid language, and work on communicating with other species has recently met with justified skepticism [3]. 

 

## We were promised Darwin

Crows are generally not endangered, and actually tend to thrive in the presence of humans.
