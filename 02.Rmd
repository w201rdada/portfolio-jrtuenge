## Bright minds shrouded in darkness

Growing up in the country, I had been taught that a helpless bird on the ground was as good as dead. So when I found a young crow one day in my back yard, I dispatched it thinking this was a mercy. A year later, its friends and family still hadn't forgiven me. Several years later, I watched "A Murder of Crows" on PBS and finally understood the gravity of my crime []. Although I've served my penance in their minds, my interest in corvids and other intelligent wild birds has since only grown. 

American crows are known to have over 20 different calls []. They "sing" (albeit rather obnoxiously to most human ears) in subsong. We have not yet established a robust means of conversing with crows or any other intelligent non-human species on its own terms. Without such communication, we cannot reliably distinguish sentience from basic problem solving and parroting (i.e., mimicry). Science is full of surprises, and the potential benefits (for humans and non-humans alike) of inter-species communication can only be guessed at in the interim. 

## Many birds, one Rosetta stone

If we can make earbuds capable of real-time translation [], surely we can also make speakers to complete the circuit.

The intelligence of crows and other corvids is not lost on the machine-learning community []. However, there does not appear to be much research yet into application of data science to understanding corvid language, and work on communicating with other species has recently met with justified skepticism []. 

 

## We were promised Darwin

Crows are generally not endangered, and actually tend to thrive in the presence of humans. And maybe we'll only learn that, in addition to having an annoying sound, they're really only yelling at us to give them a peanut [5].
